# rejnin-bot
Hello random traveller! Honestly I don't know how you ended up here unless you know me. I see absolutely no way this can be of any help to you. Anyways, this is my first dip in "programming", a bot I wrote following [discord.js' helpful tutorial](https://discordjs.guide/). It has all the features a discord bot should typically have. Some self implemented extra features include:
* Quote system that supports images
* Birthday reminder *(in development)*
* Currency system *(also in development ok I suck at databases)*

Still in development, will consider releasing Rejnin into the wild once he's grown strong enough.
